# W02D02 - Asynchronous Control Flow

### To Do
* [x] Blocking Code
* [x] Asynchronous Programming
* [x] `setTimeout` and `setInterval`
* [x] File System Functions (`fs`)


### Async code
* synchronous

```js
const name = 'Alice';
console.log(name);
```

synchronous code has to complete before any async code will run
async functions do not have return values
